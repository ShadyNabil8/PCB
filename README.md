# Mounting technologoes

1. **Through-hole technology**
   * Components:
        1. Axial lead component (like resistor)
        2. Radial lead component (like led)

* Axial lead components take more space than radial lead. We can try to reshape the axial component to be like this the radial one to take less space.
* Generally, a component that take less space allow ou to put more components in smaller space and that may cause a problem with high **frequency** signals and also the **heat** will be more concentrated in smaller space.

#### Advantages

1. Strong bond between board and the component make it preferred for larger components.
2. Can withstand more environmental stress, so it is used in military and space applications.

#### Disadvantages

1. Take more time to be made.
2. Not appropriate for high frequency applications the requires minimum capacitance and inductance in wire leads.
3. Not recommended in small area designs.
